# Final project

## SPICED Academy: Final Project

---

I had one week to come up with a final project idea and to realise it for my graduation at the SPICED Academy. I decided to work on the design of my father's website.
For this project, I have all the backend set up (databases, socket.io, registration/login option, password hashing etc.) incase my father wants to use this design and carry on with the code. I used React because it's a good option if you end-up building a larger website.
As for the design, I used parallax scrolling and particles as a way to start experimenting with design.
For now, this project is intended for learning purposes only.
